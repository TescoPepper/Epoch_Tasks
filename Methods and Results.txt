Task 1 Method:

	1. Filtered Data to have only the pincodes of Maharshtra state and saved it in new file
	2. Filtering the Data to the known Latitudinal and Longitudinal bounds of the state
	3. Plotting the Data as a scatter plot
	4. Making a K-Means Algorithm (Reference in notebook)
	5. Running the K-Means algorithm on the data with K = 36 (No. of Districts in Maharashtra)

Task 2 Method:
	
	1. Cleaning the CV data
	2. Splitting the data into train and test then encoding
	3. Constructing a CNN model
	4. Cutting the target images into respective cells (28 x 28 pixel letters)
	5. Running each cell through the CNN model
	6. Compiling the resultant characters into sentences
	7. Importing Sentiment Analysis Data
	8. Vectorizing both Sentiment Analysis Data and the compiled sentences from the CNN model
	9. Constructing a Multinomial Naive Bayes Model and a Simple RNN
	10. Running the vectorized data through both the models to have final results of sentiment

Result Task 1:

	The plotted state represents the actual state well
	The medium to large sized districts are represented well
	Insights in notebook

Result Task 2:

	Naive Bayes model gives and accuracy of 100%!
	Simple RNN gives a relatively low accuracy of 33% - 50%...
